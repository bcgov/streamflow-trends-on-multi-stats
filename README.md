# streamflow-trends-on-multi-stats
This code works on Water Survey of Canada hydrometric data to compute annual mean, minimum and maximum, monthly mean, June through September minimum and April through June maximum and seasonal mean streamflow. Trends are computed on each statistic with the zyp.yuepilon function of the zyp trend package. All code is written in R.
